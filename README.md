# SefariaViewer

# This is a project to ultimately create an offline means of viewing the documents hosted on sefaria.org via a TUI. It is implementing the rich and BS4 python libraries, and using files from the Sefaria github. 

###as of last commit (12/11/2024 10:45pmMDT), there is a Mei Hashiloach script in the main directory. I am working through it to make the project more flexible at parsing the .json files.
